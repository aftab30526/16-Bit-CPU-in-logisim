# 16-Bit-CPU-in-logisim
I designed a 16-bit CPU in Logisim, creating and integrating components such as an Adder, Subtractor, Multiplier, Memory, Comparator, Decoder, ALU, and Move Operations into a fully functional architecture. This project provided hands-on experience in binary computation, data flow, control signals, and the inner workings of a CPU.
